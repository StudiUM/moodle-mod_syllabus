# Syllabus Moodle Plugin
This is a Syllabus plugin for Moodle, developped by the Université de Montréal.

It allows:

* teachers to enter syllabus data
* students to view and download the syllabus

Please note that this plugin is not intended to be used as is: you will need a developer to modify and customize it according to the needs of your institution. You will also need to translate some texts that are only in French.
